# HTML & CSS - First App

This project contains a web page built with basic HTML and CSS, where JavaScript is used to dynamically modify the styles of elements on the page. The styles and content of the page's elements are modified using **DOM Navigation**.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple web page where various sections (header, page title, content, footer) have their styles and content dynamically changed using JavaScript. In this project:

- Initial CSS styles are applied to the page,
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation) is used to dynamically modify the styles and content of page elements,
- The HTML contains a `container` div, which includes the header, page title, content, and footer sections.
